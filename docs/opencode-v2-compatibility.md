# OpenCode v2 (`opencode2`) Compatibility

oh-my-opencode-slim installs and runs on **both** OpenCode v1 (`opencode`)
and OpenCode v2 (`opencode2`) from a single published package. This document
describes how each host loads the plugin, what is supported where, and how to
register it.

The verified compatibility baseline is **OpenCode v2.0.3 stable** (Sep 12,
2026). The stable line so far — v2.0.0 (Sep 11) through v2.0.3 — shipped 35
commits with **zero `packages/plugin` API changes** (every fix landed
elsewhere), so the plugin's shim targets are valid across the whole v2.0.x
range, not just the newest patch release.

## How it works

The package's default export is an object:

```ts
export default {
  id: 'oh-my-opencode-slim',
  server: OhMyOpenCodeLite, // v1 plugin function (PluginInput) => Promise<Hooks>
  setup: createV2Setup(),   // v2 promise-plugin setup (ctx) => Promise<cleanup>
};
```

There is deliberately **no `tui` key** on this export: hosts validate a
server plugin module's `tui` field (it must be a function and must not
coexist with `server`), so a boolean `tui: true` marker gets the whole
plugin rejected with "invalid tui export".

- **v1 loader** (`readV1Plugin` in `packages/opencode/src/plugin/shared.ts`)
  detects an object with a `server` field and calls `plugin.server(input)`
  with the full v1 `PluginInput`. Extra keys (such as `setup`) are ignored on
  this path.
- **Embedded v2 pass on v1 hosts.** Every v1 host (≥ v1.17.10) also boots
  the v2 core, which reads the same config (migrating `plugin:` entries to
  `plugins:`) and calls `setup(ctx)` with a registration-only context
  (agent/aisdk/catalog/command/integration/plugin/reference/skill — no
  tool/session/event/mcp/generate). A dual-export plugin registered via the
  v1 `plugin:` key therefore gets **both** invocations: full v1
  functionality flows through `server()`, while the parallel pass produces
  the expected `[v2] … failed` / `bridges: 4` log noise (see
  [Environment caveats](#environment-caveats)). A v2 `plugins:` entry yields
  the setup pass alone — v1 does not convert v2 plugin declarations into v1
  hooks.
- **v2 loader** (`PluginModule` schema in
  `packages/core/src/plugin/supervisor.ts`) decodes `default` as
  `{ id, setup }` (Effect Schema 4 rejects function defaults) and calls
  `setup(ctx)` via the promise-plugin bridge.
- **v2 TUI** loads the `./tui` entry unconditionally: the TUI runtime runs
  its own `kind: "tui"` loader pass over the same plugin list and resolves
  the entry through the package's `exports["./tui"]` map — the server-side
  export plays no role in that discovery.

Three builds are produced:

| Export | File | Build | Externals |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.` (main) | `dist/index.js` | `build:plugin` | zod, jsdom, @opencode-ai/*, @opentui/* (shared with v1 host) |
| `./server` | `dist/server/index.js` | `build:v2` | jsdom only (self-contained for v2) |
| `./tui` | `dist/tui2.js` | `build:tui` | same external set as `build:plugin` (composes the v1 TUI entry; inlines zod) |

v2's plugin resolver tries the `server` subpath first
(`subpaths: ["server", ""]`), which the exports map resolves directly to
`dist/server/index.js` — the self-contained v2 server bundle, and also the
entrypoint v2 loads when the `dist/server` directory is registered directly
(see [Installing on v2](#installing-on-v2)); the release artifact check
requires it. v1 uses the main entry.

Upstream npm naming split with the stable line: v2 ships as
`@opencode/plugin` / `@opencode/client` / `@opencode/sdk` / `@opencode/cli`
(at `2.0.x`), while `@opencode-ai/plugin` and `@opencode-ai/sdk` are V1-only
packages (latest `1.18.30`) that will never carry the v2 surface. The plugin
intentionally keeps its v1 runtime pins and hand-mirrors the subset of the v2
plugin context it consumes in `src/v2/types.ts` — the v1 host must be able to
load the main build with no v2 package installed. This is a known tradeoff,
not an oversight: the mirror is refreshed by hand and can drift from
upstream, so every v2 release bump needs a deliberate diff of
`src/v2/types.ts` against the new `@opencode/plugin`.

Verified live on OpenCode v2 (all bridges green — health check
`bridges:11`, +1 on hosts that accept the `session.model.request` hook
name for the chat.headers bridge; the event stream, bridges, and
orchestrator-wake children-driven degraded mode are exercised end-to-end
on the stable host — live mock-driven re-verification on 2026-09-09
included a queued wake firing after 60 s of parent idle with a stalled
background child). Every v2 API the adapter touches is
capability-probed at runtime (`typeof ctx.mcp?.transform === 'function'`,
`s.switchModel`, `ctx.generate`, …), so a host lacking one capability
degrades that single feature with a log line instead of breaking the load.
`ctx.mcp.transform` in particular is present in **all** v2.0.x stable hosts;
its probe only ever matters on pre-stable beta builds.

## The v2 adapter (`src/v2/setup.ts`)

`setup(ctx)` wraps the existing v1 factory rather than reimplementing it:

1. Builds a v1-shaped `PluginInput` from the v2 context
   (`src/v2/client-shim.ts`): the project directory from `ctx.location`,
   and a shim `client` that **really delegates** the v1 SDK call shapes to
   v2 flat session calls — `session.get`, `session.abort`→`interrupt`,
   `session.messages`→`context`, `session.prompt` (as `delivery: "steer"`),
   `session.update`→`rename`, `session.delete`→`remove` (same
   `DELETE /api/session/:id`; stops the smartfetch secondary-model temp
   sessions leaking), and `session.list` (v2 `Session.Info` page → the v1
   `{data}` envelope with `directory` derived from `location` and `outcome`
   mapped, used by the interview dashboard's session scan and the
   orchestrator-wake children enumeration). Note that `remove` and `list`
   are **not part of the stock v2 plugin session domain** — the
   capability probes only succeed on hosts that extend it, and all v2.0.x
   stable hosts take the degraded paths (see
   [Not exposed to plugins: `session.list` / `session.remove`](#not-exposed-to-plugins-sessionlist-sessionremove)).
   The shim marks the input `hostFlavor: 'v2'` and never fakes success
   shapes: methods the host lacks degrade with an honest log (or are
   omitted entirely, as with `session.get`, so capability probes see the
   truth).
2. Invokes `OhMyOpenCodeLite(pluginInput)` to reuse **all** existing build
   logic (config, agents, tools, hooks, job board, multiplexer, companion).
3. Runs the v1 `config()` hook against a synthesized config to resolve agent
   models and the slash commands.
4. Bridges the returned v1 `Hooks` into v2 registrations:
   - `agent` → `ctx.agent.transform` (model/prompt/permission adaptation +
     `subagent`/`execute` permission mapping + `draft.default("orchestrator")`).
     On v2 hosts the generated orchestrator/council prompts already use
     native wording (`subagent` tool, `agent` param); the `task`→`subagent`
     prompt rewrite remains only as a fallback for user-custom presets
    - `tool` → `ctx.tool.transform` (zod shape → JSON schema; execute
      shimmed; every registration carries `options: {codemode: false}` —
      see the feature matrix note below)
   - `mcp` → `ctx.mcp.transform` (`draft.set(name, adaptMcpServer(cfg))` for
     the built-in MCPs)
   - `command` → `ctx.command.transform` — v2 command drafts are add-only:
     `draft.add({name, description, execute})`. `execute` submits a
     `<omos-cmd-command data-name="...">` marker as a user prompt; the
     session context hook recovers it and dispatches to the v1
     `command.execute.before` hook (deepwork/reflect/loop)
    - a single `ctx.session.hook("context")` handles the system/messages
      transforms (SystemPart[]/Message.content shape conversion),
      `chat.message` agent tracking, and interview + generic command marker
      dispatch — mutating only the trailing message so earlier content stays
      byte-identical (provider prompt-cache prefix reuse). While the
      bridged messages transform runs, parts injected through
      `cache-safe-injection` carry a v2 `ContentPart.cache`
      `{type: "ephemeral"}` hint (CacheHint tagging) so providers that
      honor manual breakpoints cap the injected zone's cache contribution;
      the hint is scoped per request (an `AsyncLocalStorage` scope around
      the bridged transform) so concurrent sessions' transforms cannot
      interleave their set/restore, and the v1 pipeline never enters the
      scope, so v1 payload bytes never change.
    - a native `ctx.session.hook("prompt")` registration (capability-
      guarded): the v2 prompt hook fires **once per admitted input** with
      the eventual inbox User `messageID`, giving the v1 `chat.message`
      consumers (task-session-manager / orchestrator-wake
      `observeChatMessage`, `toolLoopGuard.observeNewUserMessage`) true
      once-per-admission fidelity with prompt parts. The FIRST admitted
      prompt per session is deferred until the first agent-bearing
      context event arrives, then delivered once with parts + agent
      together — the v1 `chat.message` handler only registers the session
      agent when a delivery carries one, and its consumers gate on that
      registration, so an agent-less first forward would be dropped (lost
      input-wait latch clearing / wake-progress rearm). Bounded fallbacks
      (next admission, or a context event whose trailing user message has
      moved past the pending one) flush a still-pending prompt best-known
      when no agent is ever learned. When the prompt hook registers, the
      context hook's per-request `chat.message` emulation narrows to
      agent/model discovery; hosts that reject the hook name keep the
      full emulation as fallback.
    - a native `ctx.session.hook("model.request")` registration
      (capability-guarded): the v2 equivalent of the v1 `chat.headers` hook.
      Fires once per provider request with a mutable `headers` record the
      host merges into the outgoing HTTP request. The bridge replays the v1
      Copilot initiator-header semantics: for `github-copilot` /
      `github-copilot-enterprise` primary requests whose trailing user
      message is an internal-initiator admission (orchestrator-wake queue
      prompts, foreground-fallback replays), it sets `x-initiator: agent`
      so Copilot's backend does not account plugin-driven turns as user
      activity. The internal marker is learned in-band — prompt `metadata`
      persisted onto the transcript user message (visible on the
      context-event envelope) plus an admission tracker for
      `session.synthetic` wakes (synthetic admissions skip the prompt hook
      and the host drops their metadata from the LLM envelope, so the shim
      records a client-chosen `msg_`-prefixed admission id the host
      honors). Auxiliary kinds (compaction/title/generate) are skipped —
      v2's built-in Copilot provider hook already marks those, and the
      native fetch layer only escalates a pre-set `x-initiator: agent`
      (never resets it to `user`), so the bridge composes with the
      built-in. Known deviation: v1 also treats compaction-continuation
      turns (`compaction_continue` part metadata) as internal; v2 core has
      no such key and the bridge checks only the plugin metadata key, so a
      primary continuation turn following compaction of an
      internal-initiated session goes unmarked (false-negative only — a
      narrow window that can only under-mark, never over-mark). Headers
      are transport-level; no payload content is read or mutated. Hosts
      that reject the hook name keep the pre-bridge behavior (header
      simply unset) with a one-time log.
    - `tool.execute.before/after` → `ctx.tool.hook` via
      `createToolExecuteBridges` (`src/v2/setup.ts`): the host `subagent`
      tool is normalized to v1 `task` semantics (name mapping, `agent`→
      `subagent_type`, `sessionID`→`task_id`, and back after the hook so
      v2 executes the repaired input). A throwing `execute.before`
      **rethrows** — v2 rejects the tool call, which is how the v1
      anti-duplicate / relaunch-lease guards enforce on v2. The after
      bridge honors v2's status discrimination: `error` events synthesize
      the v1 after-hook output from the error text (so json-error-recovery
      still appends its reminder to a failed call's output), and an
      errored call never presents its result content as a success.
    - `event` → `ctx.event.subscribe()` loop feeding `mapV2EventToV1`
      (`src/v2/event-adapter.ts`): additive synthesis only — the raw v2 event
      is always dispatched first (the interview bridge depends on it), then
      synthesized v1 shapes: flat child `session.created` → v1
      early-registration `{info: {id, parentID, agent?}}`, flat
      `session.deleted` → the v1 deletion-cleanup shape carrying **both**
      id spellings the v1 consumers read (`properties.info.id` for the
      cache monitor's session eviction, `properties.sessionID` for the
      task-session-manager's tombstone/board teardown; no `generation` is
      fabricated, so the event-router's unproven-relaunch deletion fence
      keeps its strength), usage telemetry
      (`session.usage.updated`/`session.step.ended`) → a deduplicated
      completed-assistant `message.updated` for the cache monitor, the Form
      flow (`form.created`/`form.replied`/`form.cancelled`) → v1
      `question.asked`/`question.replied`/`question.rejected`
      (`form.id` → the question request id; forms owned by the `"global"`
      sentinel are skipped), and `permission.asked` field mapping to the v1
      names (`permission` ← `action`, `patterns` ← `resources`;
      `permission.replied` passes through raw — v2's shape already matches
      the v1 event). V2 hosts publish durable `session.execution.started/
      succeeded/failed/interrupted` and emit no busy/idle `session.status`
      and no `session.idle` on the event stream — the observed payloads
      always ride under `data` (verified live, 80-event capture). The
      adapter synthesizes the v1 lifecycle shapes from those execution
      events (`started` → busy `session.status`; terminal subtypes → idle
      `session.status` + `session.idle`; `failed` → a v1 `session.error`
      with the host error payload before the idle pair), and no
      `session.status`-based fallback remains. The execution-event
      synthesis keeps orchestrator-wake suppression/arm scheduling and the
      foreground fallback working on v2 hosts, while the Form and
      permission bridges above feed the companion's waiting-input
      indicator and the task-session-manager input-wait gate.
   - `generate.text` → one-shot generation channel probed on `ctx.generate`
     and threaded as `experimental_v2.generateText`, powering the webfetch
     secondary-model summaries without a temp session
   - `dispose` → returned cleanup

Each bridge is independently try/catch-guarded so one failure cannot disable
the rest, and a zero-registration load logs a loud health-check warning.

## Feature matrix

| Capability | v1 (`opencode`) | v2 (`opencode2`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator + specialist agents, prompts & permission mapping | ✅ | ✅ `ctx.agent.transform` | — |
| Delegation + background job board + `task_*` tools | ✅ `task` tool | ✅ host `subagent` (auto-bridged: name/args normalization in `src/v2/delegation.ts`, output parsing in the execute bridges) | — |
| Tools (ast-grep, webfetch, task_message/task_cancel/task_revive, wait_for_user, acp_run) | ✅ | ✅ `ctx.tool.transform` | v2 requires `options: {codemode: false}` on each registration (CodeMode split): without it a tool registers cleanly but is confined to the `execute` tool's JS runtime and session catalogs yield `Unknown tool: <name>`. The plugin stamps it on every adapted tool (`adaptTool` in `src/v2/adapters.ts`; additive field, older hosts ignore it). ast-grep needs its CLI binary (package, system, or lazy download); webfetch needs `jsdom` resolvable |
| Slash commands `/deepwork` `/reflect` `/loop` | ✅ | ✅ marker round-trip | — |
| `/interview` | ✅ | ✅ marker command + trailing-message context bridge | — |
| Message transforms (phase reminder, skills filter, image routing, display-name rewrite) | ✅ | ✅ via the single context hook | — |
| Event handling (session tracking, lifecycle, cache telemetry) | ✅ | ✅ event pump + additive v2→v1 synthesis | — |
| Tool execute hooks (apply-patch recovery, task-session, json-recovery) | ✅ | ✅ `createToolExecuteBridges` with subagent→task normalization | — |
| Built-in MCPs (context7, gh_grep) auto-registered | ✅ | ✅ `ctx.mcp.transform` | `ctx.mcp.transform` is present in all v2.0.x stable hosts; the runtime capability probe only ever matters on pre-stable beta builds |
| webfetch secondary-model summaries | ✅ | ✅ via `ctx.generate.text` | host without `ctx.generate` → summaries unavailable (logged) |
| Background-job state persistence (tombstones, deletion epochs, alias high-water marks) | ➖ process-local | ✅ via `ctx.storage` | optional domain; absent → pure in-memory fallback, zero behavior change (see [Background job state](#background-job-state-rehydrate-probe-and-persistence)) |
| Foreground model fallback (rate-limit failover) | ✅ | ✅ shim translates re-prompt into `session.switchModel` + `delivery:"steer"` prompt | — |
| `/preset` (interactive switcher) | ✅ | ✅ TUI plugin entry (`./tui` → `dist/tui2.js`): sidebar + `/preset` dialog or `/preset <name>` fast path | The layer registers from an `append: "app"` slot render because the host's `keymap.layer` is provider-scoped (calling it from plugin `setup` throws `Keymap.Provider is missing`); the command carries an `id` and `slash.arguments`; host needs `ui.slot` + `keymap.layer`; the interactive picker needs `ui.dialog.select` while `/preset <name>` works without it; feedback uses `ui.toast.show`; config-file `preset` still applies at load |
| TUI default agent | ✅ orchestrator | ✅ orchestrator — `draft.default("orchestrator")`; the v2 TUI honors `default_agent` and hoists the default to the head of the agent list | — |
| Multiplexer (tmux/zellij/herdr/cmux panes) | ✅ | ❌ host-gated off (`hostFlavor: 'v2'` → `shouldEnableMultiplexer` returns false and the session manager is forced to `type: "none"`) | by design — v2 renders subagents natively |
| Orchestrator-wake scheduler | ✅ todo-gated (host `todo`/`children`/`status` APIs) | ✅ children-driven degraded mode (`backgroundJobs.orchestratorWake.mode`) | v2 wake enumerates children via `session.list({parentID})` with an event-tracked fallback, gates on children without a terminal `outcome` (staleness-bounded), and delivers with `queue`; v2's native subagent completion nudges still cover the happy path — the port adds a periodic watchdog for stuck children and unreconciled jobs |
| `chat.headers` (Copilot `x-initiator` routing) | ✅ | ✅ via `session.hook("model.request")` | transport-level only; auxiliary kinds are covered by v2's built-in Copilot provider hook |
| Companion app | ✅ | ⚠️ unverified | independent desktop app; test separately against v2 |

## Upstream behaviors to know

Behaviors of v2 itself that plugin authors should know about — none
currently break this plugin:

- **Event payloads ride under `data`, not `properties`.** The v2
  event stream (SSE and `ctx.event.subscribe()`) frames each event as
  `{id, created, type, location?, durable?, metadata?, data}` — the payload
  is the `data` record, unlike the v1 SDK's `properties` (verified live:
  every observed event keyed `["id","created","type","durable","data"]`,
  with the optional `metadata?` key observed on some events).
  The adapter reads `data` first with `properties` as a legacy fallback and
  always writes `properties` on the synthesized v1 shapes, because that is
  the key the v1 consumers read. The interview bridge's event handler
  (`handleEvent` in `src/v2/interview-bridge.ts`) resolves its payload
  data-first the same way — reading only `properties` had left its
  transcript projection and deletion cleanup dead on live v2 for every
  event (`handleContext` is unaffected; it consumes a different event
  type).
- **`session.deleted` is synthesized with a dual id spelling.** v2
  delivers deletion flat (`{sessionID}`), and the v1 deletion consumers
  read two different spellings: the cache monitor's session eviction
  reads `properties.info.id`, while the task-session-manager's
  deletion handler accepts `properties.sessionID`. The synthesized v1
  event therefore carries both. Without this synthesis the deletion
  cleanup (rehydrate tombstone, board teardown, idle-token/input-wait
  clears) never fired on v2, and deleted runs resurrected as
  forever-running ghost records on the next request.
- **Lifecycle keys on `session.execution.*`.** V2 hosts publish durable
  `session.execution.started/succeeded/failed/interrupted` events
  (`{sessionID}`, plus `error` on `.failed` and `reason` on
  `.interrupted`) and emit no busy/idle `session.status` and no
  `session.idle` on the event stream (`session.status` remains only in the
  schema). The adapter synthesizes the v1 lifecycle shapes from the
  execution events (`started` → busy `session.status`; terminal subtypes →
  idle `session.status` + `session.idle`; `failed` → a v1 `session.error`
  with the host error payload passed through best-effort, emitted before
  the idle pair so the error-then-idle flow the event-router expects is
  preserved). Without this synthesis the orchestrator-wake scheduler never
  arms on live v2 hosts.
- **Transcript user messages carry no identity.** Context-hook
  transcript user messages on live v2 hosts carry `{id, time, text,
  type}` only — no `agent`, no `sessionID`. The v1 injection gates
  (phase-reminder, background-job-board, post-file-tool-nudge) key on
  user-message `info.agent`/`info.sessionID`, so every injection would
  skip. The v2 context bridge stamps the context event's `sessionID` and
  the session's known agent (from the event, falling back to the
  session-prompt bridge's learned state) onto transcript user messages
  before the bridged messages transform runs — metadata-only envelope
  enrichment, strictly absence-gated (host-provided values never
  overwritten), parts/content bytes untouched, idempotent across
  context events. This also makes the CacheHint-tagged injected parts
  observable on live v2 hosts.
- **Runtime status reconciliation is capability-gated.** v2 has no
  equivalent of the v1 live session-status map (`client.session.status`
  is not a function on v2 hosts; `session.status` is not exposed to
  plugins as of v2.0.3), so the task-session-manager's
  runtime-status reconciliation poll is disabled entirely on hosts
  without the method — a single per-instance log line notes the
  disabled reconciliation instead of logging uncertainty every ~5s poll.
  v1 hosts expose the method and keep the exact historical polling
  behavior. Background job stop-confirmation was never obtainable from
  the v2 poll anyway (the lookup failed every time).
- **Stable-line plugin API additions (verified in v2.0.3).** Between the
  pre-stable betas and v2.0.0, upstream grew the plugin surface with
  session hooks `compaction`, `generate`, and `title` (the title and
  compaction hooks may set `result` to skip the model call entirely),
  per-session `permission.rules`, and TUI `ui.tabs.move()` (with
  `tabs.open` no longer focusing a tab and `tabs.focus` now opening the
  tab if needed). The `SessionContext` request shape also merged
  `generation` and `providerOptions` into a single `options` object —
  the plugin is unaffected: its context bridge mutates only
  system/messages, and cache hints ride `ContentPart.cache`, which is
  unchanged. Adoption status: the **compaction hook is adopted** — the
  plugin strips its tagged synthetic parts from the compaction input
  (new in this release); the `generate` session hook (not the
  `ctx.generate` text channel the webfetch summaries use), the `title`
  hook, `permission.rules`, and the new `tabs` methods are not used —
  deterministic child titles via the title hook are future work.
  Upstream is still actively fixing compaction×hook plumbing and
  compaction×cache behavior after v2.0.3, so compaction-hook semantics
  may evolve; the plugin's hook callback is written shape-tolerant
  (messages-only mutation) to ride those changes.
- **Duplicate idle delivery.** The adapter synthesizes both an idle
  `session.status` and a `session.idle` from each terminal execution event,
  so a consumer watching both sees idle twice per terminal transition.
  Current consumers are idempotent per session (idle-reconciliation's
  per-session timer guards); new idle consumers must tolerate duplicate
  delivery.
- **Duplicate `permission.asked` delivery.** The adapter appends a
  v1-field-mapped copy after the raw v2 `permission.asked` event (raw
  first is a load-bearing invariant for v2-native handlers). Consumers
  watching both see the ask twice with the same request id — safe because
  every ask consumer is idempotent per request id (the input-wait
  tracker's Set, the companion's status setters, wake suppression); new
  ask consumers must tolerate it, like idle.
- **Question flow is Form-based.** v2 replaced `question.*` with the Form
  flow; the adapter synthesizes `question.asked/replied/rejected` from
  `form.created/replied/cancelled` so v1 consumers keep working. Forms
  owned by the `"global"` sentinel session (MCP elicitation) are not
  synthesized — v1 question events are session-scoped.
- **MCP tool-name namespaces are host-generated.** This plugin never
  matches raw MCP tool names: MCP access is granted per server name
  (`"mcps": ["context7", "!gh_grep"]` in agent config), and registration
  uses its own server names via `draft.set(name, ...)`.

## Installing on v2

Add the npm package, **pinned to an exact version** — v2 auto-refreshes
unpinned npm plugins on every startup, so `@latest` effectively means
"silently upgrade whenever a new version ships". The global config root is
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, shared with v1 (`~/.config/opencode2/`
is not read for plugin config):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["oh-my-opencode-slim@2.2.17"]
}
```

For local development, point the config at the built `dist/server`
**directory**:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["/path/to/oh-my-opencode-slim/dist/server"]
}
```

Then build:

```bash
bun install
bun run build   # produces dist/index.js (v1), dist/server/index.js (v2
                # server bundle, also served via the ./server subpath),
                # dist/tui2.js (v2 TUI), dist/cli/
```

Verify with `opencode2 run "list your specialist agents" --standalone` — the
orchestrator should name explorer, librarian, oracle, designer, fixer.

### Registration rules

- **Directory or package entries only.** File-path entries (e.g.
  `…/dist/server.js`) are rejected with the WARN
  `configured plugin path must be a directory`. A directory entry's
  `index.js` is the entrypoint — hence `dist/server` above.
- **Single-file plugins need a wrapper dir** whose `index.js` re-exports the
  original file, e.g. `~/.config/opencode/plugins-dev/<name>/index.js`
  containing `export { default } from "/abs/path/to/plugin.js";`. Do not
  use the auto-scanned dir names `plugin`/`plugins` for wrapper dirs — a
  scanned duplicate next to an explicit registration hard-dies on duplicate
  plugin ID.

## Configuring models on v2

Agent models are resolved the same way as v1 (per-agent `model` in
`oh-my-opencode-slim.json`, or inherited from the session/host default). On
v2, set a working provider+model in your config or the plugin's config file
so delegated subagents can run.

When the foreground model hits a rate limit, the plugin switches the
session's model (`session.switchModel`) and steers the re-prompt through
`delivery: "steer"`. A failing `switchModel` call degrades honestly: the
re-prompt is still delivered (on the current model) and the plugin's logs
record that no switch happened — the fallback chain is not aborted. On
hosts without `session.switchModel`, the fallback replay is rejected with
a clear error instead of silently replaying on the model that just failed
(other prompt callers, like the orchestrator-wake scheduler, only pin the
current model and keep steering).

## Background job state: rehydrate probe and persistence

Two mechanisms keep the in-memory background job board honest against the
host across process and plugin restarts:

### Rehydrate existence probe (`session.get`)

Rehydration re-registers persisted *running* task tool parts so a plugin
restart does not orphan in-flight background lanes — but a session deleted
while the plugin was down would resurrect as a forever-running ghost.
After rehydration registers a task, the task-session-manager transform
fires a fire-and-forget `client.session.get` probe per newly registered
taskID:

- **Capability-gated, not host-gated — but v2-effective.** The probe runs
  whenever the client exposes `session.get`; hosts without it skip
  silently. The typed NotFound classification only crosses the v2 plugin
  boundary (the host passes the raw core effect in-process): the v1 SDK
  wraps 4xx responses as plain `Error` with a `.cause` (or returns an
  `{error}` tuple when `throwOnError: false`), so on v1 hosts the probe
  runs but harmlessly never tombstones — the wrapped rejection falls into
  the transient fail-open path. The probe lives inside the existing
  task-session-manager transform — no new pipeline step.
- **NotFound classification is typed, never heuristic.** A rejection
  tombstones the task only when `err._tag === 'Session.NotFoundError'`
  (property check; never `instanceof` or message matching — the SDK error
  class identity is unstable across host builds). Cleanup is
  generation-freshness-guarded: the board record's generation is captured
  before the async `get`, and a NotFound that resolves after a legitimate
  same-ID relaunch (new generation, tombstone cleared) skips all cleanup
  instead of deleting the live relaunched record. On a fresh hit, the four
  probe cleanup actions run as one synchronous block — supervisor
  `onSessionDeleted` first (it needs the record to exist so
  deadline-exceeded runs finalize their wall-clock timeout; same ordering
  as the event-router/coordinator deletion paths), then the rehydrate
  tombstone, board drop, and concurrency `releaseTask` (all idempotent; a
  missing `releaseTask` would leak an admission slot forever). The
  canonical full deletion cleanup (input waits, idle tokens, pending-call
  tracker, `clearParent`, task-context tracker, snapshots) runs via the
  `session.deleted` event path.
- **Any other rejection fails open** — the job stays registered and the
  normal reconciliation paths keep their chance. The probe never rejects
  unhandled.
- **A resolved terminal outcome settles the job** through the same
  `updateStatus` semantics as the idle-reconciliation host-outcome path:
  `succeeded` requires usable final assistant text (otherwise the
  textless-completion diagnostics apply, per the #1115 precedent);
  `failed`/`interrupted` settle as error with the host outcome recorded.

Related injection hardening: a remembered (possibly stale) processed
completion now skips *cleanly* — the fence check runs before the
deletion-epoch fail-closed branch in `updateFromInjectedCompletion`, so
replaying an old completion after a delete + same-ID relaunch can no
longer poison the fresh generation with `markStatusUncertain`. Unobserved
completions for a deleted task still fail closed for every provenance
kind.

### Persistence via `ctx.storage` (v2)

When the v2 host exposes the optional `storage` domain, the plugin
persists background-job lifecycle state through
`src/utils/background-job-persistence.ts` (configured in `setup` before
the v1 factory runs):

- **Tombstones and deletion epochs** are write-through: every in-memory
  ledger mutation queues a matching persisted update, so the persisted
  state tracks the ledger (writes are fire-and-forget — a crash between
  the in-memory mutation and the queue flush loses that persisted entry,
  an accepted degradation to process-local behavior). Clearing a tombstone
  on a legitimate relaunch is persisted too — a deleted-then-relaunched
  task is *not* ghost-skipped after a restart, while its deletion epoch
  survives for generation fencing (restored epochs keep the epoch counter
  monotonic).
- **Alias counters** persist the last-seen counter per
  `<parentSessionID>:<prefix>`. A post-restart board seeds from these
  high-water marks, so a new alias never collides with a historical one.
  The alias→taskID mapping itself is **not** restored — old aliases
  resolve as not-found after a restart, which is the intended improvement
  over silently reusing them for unrelated tasks.
- **Seeding is backend-only.** Without `ctx.storage` (v1 hosts, hosts
  without the domain) the module is a pure in-memory no-op sink: zero
  behavior change, fresh boards and ledgers start exactly as
  process-local as before.
- **Bounded and serialized.** Persisted tombstones (and their epoch
  entries) self-cap at the 500 most recent by recorded time; writes for
  one key are serialized in-process (no concurrent read-modify-write);
  write failures log and degrade to process-local behavior.

### Diagnostics

Two log lines aid drift diagnosis (both hosts): the task tool's terminal
output that carries no parsable task id is logged with a ~140-char
preview (`task output without a task id` — the host-output-drift
detector), and an idle observation for a *tracked managed child* with no
running board record logs with a `[task-session-manager] WARN:` prefix
instead of the routine idle line.

**Secret redaction at the logger.** Every plugin log line — file sink,
stderr fallback, and the append-failure path — passes through
shape-based secret redaction at the logger's single compose point
(`src/utils/redact.ts`): known vendor token prefixes (`sk-`, `gh*`,
`glpat-`, `xox*`, `AKIA`/`ASIA`), URL credentials
(`scheme://user:password@` — password only), authorization schemes
(Bearer/Basic/token), and generic 32+-character opaque runs are masked
to 4 leading + 2 trailing characters. This is a best-effort barrier
against *accidental* leaks in short previews, not an adversarial
guarantee: unprefixed short secrets, secrets containing run-breaking
characters, and chunked or obfuscated content remain residual gaps,
while long opaque non-secrets (UUIDs, hashes, long paths) are masked as
accepted false positives. The parse-miss preview (`task output without
a task id`) is stricter still: it is **structure-only** — tag and field
names survive for drift diagnosis, but every value (XML attribute
values, `key:`/`key=` prose values) is fully replaced with `[masked]`
before slicing, because parse-miss content is untrusted-by-format and
values (description fields in particular) carry user-authored text.
All other log sites rely on the shape-based redaction at the logger
choke point.

## Limitations

### Interview

`/interview` is supported on v2 through a marker command and a
trailing-message context bridge. The bridge keeps an in-memory transcript
projection from v2 context and streamed text events, and uses the v2 session
methods for prompts, notifications, and renames. Interview notifications
admit the synthetic input with `resume: false` — the interview URL lands in
the session without waking an agent turn (the v1 `noReply` prompt
equivalent). The markdown document
remains the durable source of truth; completion responses without
`<interview_state>` rewrite the current spec while retaining frontmatter and
Q&A history.

### v1-only, by design

- **Multiplexer panes.** tmux/zellij/herdr integration is a v1-TUI feature;
  v2 renders subagents natively, so the multiplexer is host-gated off on v2
  (`shouldEnableMultiplexer` / `sessionManagerMultiplexerConfig` in
  `src/index.ts`).

### Not exposed to plugins: `session.list` / `session.remove`

The v2 plugin session domain (`packages/plugin/src/promise/session.ts`,
`SessionDomain`, mirrored by the runtime object the promise adapter
builds) exposes exactly `create`/`get`/`switchAgent`/`switchModel`/
`prompt`/`generate`/`command`/`synthetic`/`interrupt`/`rename`/`move`/
`wait`/`context` — **`list` and `remove` are not handed to plugins**
(as of v2.0.3). Both endpoints exist on the host's HTTP API, but the
plugin context never receives them. `session.status`, `session.todo`, and
`session.children` are likewise not exposed as of v2.0.3 — the wake
scheduler's fallback enumeration, the delete no-op below, and the disabled
runtime-status reconciliation (see
[Upstream behaviors](#upstream-behaviors-to-know)) all follow from these
gaps. The client shim capability-probes both at runtime
(`typeof s.list === 'function'`, `s.remove`), so a future host that
extends the domain gets real delegation with no plugin change; on all
v2.0.x stable hosts both probes fail and the shims degrade:

- **Children enumeration (orchestrator-wake).** The shim's
  `client.session.list` returns the v1-parity empty page `{data: []}`,
  so `session.list({parentID})`-based enumeration never yields children
  and the scheduler always runs its **event-tracked fallback**
  (adapter-synthesized `session.created` parentID links plus tracked
  busy/idle statuses — the mode the doc's wake section describes as the
  fallback is effectively the only path on v2). The gate still passes
  because it probes the *shim's* `list` function, which always exists.
  The interview dashboard's session scan likewise sees no sessions from
  `list` on v2.
- **Session delete.** `client.session.delete` is a **no-op**: the
  smartfetch secondary-model temp-session cleanup cannot remove sessions
  through the shim on v2 (the temp sessions simply persist; nothing
  fails loudly).

Both degradations announce themselves in the plugin log with a single
deterministic, **one-time-per-process** warning instead of degrading
silently (`list`) or logging on every call (`remove`):

```
[v2][shim] session.list unavailable on this host build; children enumeration falls back to event tracking
[v2][shim] session.remove unavailable on this host build; session delete is a no-op
```

The guards are module-level booleans with fixed text — no timestamps,
session ids, or per-call payloads — so repeated wake polls and cleanup
calls do not flood the log (the remove warning used to fire once per
delete attempt).

### Orchestrator-wake on v2 (children-driven degraded mode)

The wake scheduler is **active on v2** in a degraded mode, configured with
`backgroundJobs.orchestratorWake.mode` (`"auto"` | `"todo"` | `"children"`,
default `"auto"`: todo-gating on v1, children-driven on v2; an explicit
`"todo"` degrades to children because v2 has no todo surface exposed to
plugins as of v2.0.3 — logged once).

How it differs from the v1 path:

- **Gate:** v2 requires only the shim's `session.list` + `promptAsync`
  (`session.get` is optional model enrichment). v1 keeps its exact
  historical probe set (`get`/`todo`/`children`/`status`/`promptAsync`).
- **Children enumeration:** `session.list({ parentID })` through the shim
  (v2 `Session.Info` → v1 envelope; `outcome` and `time.updated` mapped).
  When the listing is unavailable (missing/erroring/empty), an event-tracked
  fallback uses the adapter-synthesized `session.created` parentID links plus
  tracked busy/idle statuses — refreshed on every evaluation with the host's
  authoritative `outcome`/`time.updated` via `session.get` (fail-soft per
  child). A finished child is therefore terminal immediately instead of
  reading active for the whole staleness window, and a live child stays
  visible on its host evidence rather than dropping out on stale local
  evidence. As of v2.0.3, `session.list` is not exposed to plugins on any
  stable host
  (see
  [Not exposed to plugins](#not-exposed-to-plugins-sessionlist-sessionremove)),
  so the event-tracked fallback is the operative path. Results are scoped
  to the session's directory when the host reports one.
- **Wake condition:** children with `outcome === undefined` (v2 records an
  outcome only on terminal transition: succeeded|failed|interrupted) that
  still have fresh update evidence — host `time.updated` or a tracked status
  change newer than 3× the wake interval (staleness bound for children that
  crash mid-run without recording an outcome). Stopped-job recovery wakes
  bypass the condition, as on v1.
- **Wake delivery:** `delivery: "queue"` — v1 `prompt_async` queued, and a
  v2 `steer` would hijack an in-flight run. The shim's `promptAsync` keeps
  `steer` as the default so the foreground-fallback replay is unchanged.
  The wake model pin carries the session model's variant as the v2-only
  `modelVariant` argument, so `switchModel` preserves the reasoning-effort
  setting instead of resetting it to the host default.
- **Variant-preserving skip (shim-level guard):** a variant-less model pin
  that already matches the session's current model (same provider + id,
  read via `session.get` at delivery time) is treated as "continue on this
  model": the shim skips `switchModel` entirely instead of resetting the
  variant to default. This covers every internal caller that pins the
  current model without a variant opinion (wake pins, task-message,
  same-model fallback steps) even when the pin's source lost the variant.
  Explicit variants (including `default` via `modelVariant`) and
  cross-model pins still switch. Hosts without `session.get`, or a failing
  `get`, keep the legacy variant-free switch.
- **Fingerprint:** children-only (id + outcome + tracked status + update
  evidence); the two-wake no-progress cap still bounds cost.

v2's built-in `subagent` tool still posts completion notifications to the
parent natively — that covers the happy path. What the port adds is a
periodic watchdog: an idle parent with a stuck or unreconciled child (or a
job that stopped without a terminal result) gets woken to assess, cancel, or
respawn, bounded by the same no-progress cap as v1.

### Environment caveats

- **Reduced/TUI-side hosts.** Some host processes load the plugin's `setup`
  with a reduced, TUI-side context that lacks `agent.transform` (and other
  domains). The adapter capability-guards `setup` and skips registration
  gracefully for those hosts instead of crashing or retry-storming. The
  same applies to the embedded v2 pass inside every v1 host: it invokes
  `setup` with registration-only domains, so a v1 session's plugin log
  shows `[v2] tool.transform failed`-style lines and
  `health check passed {"bridges":4}` — expected noise from that parallel
  pass, not breakage. The classic `server()` path (a separate plugin-log
  instance a few seconds apart) carries the full v1 functionality.
- **TUI-side plugin logs are not captured.** The plugin logger initializes
  in the server process only, so TUI-side registration failures write no
  `[v2][tui]` lines anywhere. Verify TUI behavior through the host (command
  availability, on-disk effects), not via the plugin log.
- **Local-checkout loading.** When the plugin is registered from a local
  build, the externalized `jsdom` import must resolve from the plugin's
  `node_modules` (webfetch imports it lazily, so the plugin still loads
  without it — install as a package or ensure `jsdom` is resolvable to
  enable webfetch locally). AST-grep resolves its CLI independently and
  lazily downloads a binary when no package or system binary is available.
- **Companion app unverified on v2.** The companion is an independent
  desktop app; test it separately against v2 hosts.
- **Prompt-cache rules unchanged.** The v2 bridges reuse the v1 transform
  pipeline under the same cache-safety contract: only trailing messages are
  mutated, earlier content stays byte-identical, and the v1 enforcement
  suite (`src/hooks/cache-safety.property.test.ts` and friends) covers the
  shared transform code the v2 context hook invokes. The one v2-only
  addition is CacheHint tagging: parts injected through
  `cache-safe-injection` while the v2 context bridge runs carry
  `cache: {type: "ephemeral"}` (v2 `ContentPart.cache`). The hint is
  applied via a per-request scoped default (AsyncLocalStorage — the v2
  host serves different sessions' requests concurrently, so the scope
  must be isolated per bridged transform) inside the v2 bridge only — v1
  callers never set it, so the v1 payload (and its snapshots) stay
  byte-identical.
